# An-Exploration-of-Value-Added-Methodology
Ranking U.S. Colleges 

## Problem Description
Many commentators have marked the increasing importance of college to an individual's future earnings. Yet, the cost of attending college has never been higher, and people continue to lack information they can use to compare different institutions. Consequently, the importance of ranking the best colleges cannot be understated. This analysis ranks an extensive list of U.S. colleges using a value-added approach very similar to that used by [the Economist](http://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2015/10/value-university) and [the Brookings Institute](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/BMPP_CollegeValueAdded.pdf). This analysis provides insight into institutional factors of greatest value, measured by median earnings, to students. 

## Dataset
The dataset is from the [College Scorecard data webpage](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/). The College Scorecard project was created to allow students and families to compare how well different colleges are preparing their students to be successful. Thus, it has data on the performance of institutions that receive federal aid and the outcomes of their students. The data is provided through "...federal reporting from institutions, data on federal financial aid, and tax information"[Data Documentation for College Scorecard](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/BMPP_CollegeValueAdded.pdf).
